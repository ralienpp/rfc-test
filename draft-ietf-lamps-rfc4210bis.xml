    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Certificate Management Protocol (CMP).  Protocol messages are defined for X.509v3 certificate creation and management. CMP provides interactions between client systems and PKI components such as a Registration Authority (RA) and a Certification Authority (CA).</t>
      <t>This document includes the updates on RFC 4210 specified by CMP Updates [RFCAAAA] Section 2 and Appendix A.2 maintaining backward compatibility with CMP version 2 wherever possible and obsoleted both documents.  Updates to CMP version 2 are: improving crypto agility, extending the polling mechanism, adding new general message types, and adding extended key usages to identify special CMP server authorizations.  Introducing version 3 to be used only for changes to the ASN.1 syntax, which are: support of EnvelopedData instead of EncryptedValue and hashAlg for indicating a hash AlgorithmIdentifier in certConf messages.</t>
	  <t>Appendix F of this document contains the updated 2002 ASN.1 module originating from RFC 5912.</t>

      <name>PKI Management Overview</name>
      <t>
   The PKI must be structured to be consistent with the types of
   individuals who must administer it.  Providing such administrators
   with unbounded choices not only complicates the software required,
   but also increases the chances that a subtle mistake by an
   administrator or software developer will result in broader
   compromise.  Similarly, restricting administrators with cumbersome
   mechanisms will cause them not to use the PKI.</t>
      <t>
   Management protocols are REQUIRED to support on-line interactions
   between Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) components.  For example, a
   management protocol might be used between a Certification Authority
   (CA) and a client system with which a key pair is associated, or
   between two CAs that issue cross-certificates for each other.</t>
      <section anchor="sect-3.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>PKI Management Model</name>
        <t>
   Before specifying particular message formats and procedures, we first
   define the entities involved in PKI management and their interactions
   (in terms of the PKI management functions required).  We then group
   these functions in order to accommodate different identifiable types
   of end entities.</t>
        <section anchor="sect-3.1.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Definitions of PKI Entities</name>
          <t>
   The entities involved in PKI management include the end entity (i.e.,
   the entity to whom the certificate is issued) and the certification
   authority (i.e., the entity that issues the certificate).  A
   registration authority MAY also be involved in PKI management.</t>
          <section anchor="sect-3.1.1.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
            <name>Subjects and End Entities</name>
            <t>
   The term "subject" is used here to refer to the entity to whom the
   certificate is issued, typically named in the subject or
   subjectAltName field of a certificate.  When we wish to distinguish
   the tools and/or software used by the subject (e.g., a local
   certificate management module), we will use the term "subject equipment".  In general, the term "end entity" (EE), rather than
   "subject", is preferred in order to avoid confusion with the field
   name.  It is important to note that the end entities here will
   include not only human users of applications, but also applications
   themselves (e.g., for IP security) or devices (e.g., routers or industrial control systems).  This factor influences the
   protocols that the PKI management operations use; for example,
   application software is far more likely to know exactly which
   certificate extensions are required than are human users.  PKI
   management entities are also end entities in the sense that they are
   sometimes named in the subject or subjectAltName field of a
   certificate or cross-certificate.  Where appropriate, the term "end entity" will be used to refer to end entities who are not PKI
   management entities.</t>
            <t>
   All end entities require secure local access to some information --
   at a minimum, their own name and private key, the name of a CA that
   is directly trusted by this entity, and that CA's public key (or a
   fingerprint of the public key where a self-certified version is
   available elsewhere).  Implementations MAY use secure local storage
   for more than this minimum (e.g., the end entity's own certificates or
   application-specific information).  The form of storage will also
   vary -- from files to tamper-resistant cryptographic tokens.  The
   information stored in such local, trusted storage is referred to here
   as the end entity's Personal Security Environment (PSE).</t>
            <t>
   Though PSE formats are beyond the scope of this document (they are
   very dependent on equipment, et cetera), a generic interchange format
   for PSEs is defined here: a certification response message MAY be
   used.</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="sect-3.1.1.2" numbered="true" toc="default">
            <name>Certification Authority</name>
            <t>
   The certification authority (CA) may or may not actually be a real
   "third party" from the end entity's point of view.  Quite often, the
   CA will actually belong to the same organization as the end entities
   it supports.</t>
            <t>
   Again, we use the term "CA" to refer to the entity named in the
   issuer field of a certificate.  When it is necessary to distinguish
   the software or hardware tools used by the CA, we use the term "CA equipment".</t>
            <t>
   The CA equipment will often include both an "off-line" component and
   an "on-line" component, with the CA private key only available to the
   "off-line" component.  This is, however, a matter for implementers
   (though it is also relevant as a policy issue).</t>
            <t>
   We use the term "root CA" to indicate a CA that is directly trusted
   by an end entity; that is, securely acquiring the value of a root CA
   public key requires some out-of-band step(s).  This term is not meant
   to imply that a root CA is necessarily at the top of any hierarchy,
   simply that the CA in question is trusted directly.</t>
            <t>
   A "subordinate CA" is one that is not a root CA for the end entity in
   question.  Often, a subordinate CA will not be a root CA for any
   entity, but this is not mandatory.</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="sect-3.1.1.3" numbered="true" toc="default">
            <name>Registration Authority</name>
            <t>
   In addition to end-entities and CAs, many environments call for the
   existence of a Registration Authority (RA) separate from the
   Certification Authority.  The functions that the registration
   authority may carry out will vary from case to case but MAY include
   personal authentication, token distribution, checking certificate requests and authentication of their origin, revocation reporting,
   name assignment, key generation, archival of key pairs, et cetera.</t>
            <t>
   This document views the RA as an OPTIONAL component: when it is not
   present, the CA is assumed to be able to carry out the RA's functions
   so that the PKI management protocols are the same from the end-
   entity's point of view.</t>
            <t>
   Again, we distinguish, where necessary, between the RA and the tools
   used (the "RA equipment").</t>
            <t>
   Note that an RA is itself an end entity.  We further assume that all
   RAs are in fact certified end entities and that RAs have private keys
   that are usable for signing.  How a particular CA equipment
   identifies some end entities as RAs is an implementation issue (i.e.,
   this document specifies no special RA certification operation).  We
   do not mandate that the RA is certified by the CA with which it is
   interacting at the moment (so one RA may work with more than one CA
   whilst only being certified once).</t>
            <t>
   In some circumstances, end entities will communicate directly with a
   CA even where an RA is present.  For example, for initial
   registration and/or certification, the end entity may use its RA, but
   communicate directly with the CA in order to refresh its certificate.</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="sect-3.1.1.4" numbered="true" toc="default">
            <name>Key Generation Authority</name>
            <t>A Key Generation Authority (KGA) is a PKI management entity generating key pairs on behalf of an end entity.  Typically, such central key generation is performed by the CA itself.  The KGA knows the private key that it generated for the end entity.  The CA may delegate its authorization for generating key pairs on behalf of an end entity to another PKI management entity, such as an RA or a separate entity (see Section 4.5 for respective extended key usages).</t>
            <t>Note: When doing central generation of key pairs, implementers should consider the implications of server-side retention on the overall security of the system; in some case retention is good, for example for escrow reasons, but in other cases the server should clear its copy after delivery to the end entity.</t>

        <section anchor="sect-3.1.2" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>PKI Management Requirements</name>
          <t>
   The protocols given here meet the following requirements on PKI
   management</t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li> PKI management must conform to the ISO/IEC 9594-8/ITU-T X.509
        standards.</li>
            <li> It must be possible to regularly update any key pair without
        affecting any other key pair.</li>
            <li> The use of confidentiality in PKI management protocols must be
        kept to a minimum in order to ease acceptance in environments
        where strong confidentiality might cause regulatory problems.</li>
            <li> PKI management protocols must allow the use of different
        industry-standard cryptographic algorithms, see CMP Algorithms [RFCCCCC].  This means that any given
        CA, RA, or end entity may, in principle, use whichever
        algorithms suit it for its own key pair(s).</li>
            <li> PKI management protocols must not preclude the generation of key
        pairs by the end entity concerned, by a KGA, by an RA, or by a CA.  Key
        generation may also occur elsewhere, but for the purposes of PKI
        management we can regard key generation as occurring wherever
        the key is first present at an end entity, RA, or CA.</li>
            <li> PKI management protocols must support the publication of
        certificates by the end entity concerned, by an RA, or by a CA.
        Different implementations and different environments may choose
        any of the above approaches.</li>
            <li> PKI management protocols must support the production of
        Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) by allowing certified end
        entities to make requests for the revocation of certificates.
        This must be done in such a way that the denial-of-service
        attacks, which are possible, are not made simpler.</li>
            <li> PKI management protocols must be usable over a variety of
        "transport" mechanisms, specifically including mail, HTTP,
        TCP/IP, CoAP, and off-line file-based.</li>
            <li> Final authority for certification creation rests with the CA.
        No RA or end entity equipment can assume that any certificate
        issued by a CA will contain what was requested; a CA may alter
        certificate field values or may add, delete, or alter extensions
        according to its operating policy.  In other words, all PKI
        entities (end-entities, RAs, and CAs) must be capable of
        handling responses to requests for certificates in which the
        actual certificate issued is different from that requested (for
        example, a CA may shorten the validity period requested).  Note
        that policy may dictate that the CA must not publish or
        otherwise distribute the certificate until the requesting entity
        has reviewed and accepted the newly-created certificate
        (typically through use of the certConf message).</li>
            <li>A graceful, scheduled change-over from one non-compromised CA
        key pair to the next (CA key update) must be supported (note
        that if the CA key is compromised, re-initialization must be
        performed for all entities in the domain of that CA).  An end
        entity whose PSE contains the new CA public key (following a CA
        key update) must also be able to verify certificates verifiable
        using the old public key.  End entities who directly trust the
        old CA key pair must also be able to verify certificates signed
        using the new CA private key (required for situations where the
        old CA public key is "hardwired" into the end entity's
        cryptographic equipment).</li>
            <li>The functions of an RA may, in some implementations or
        environments, be carried out by the CA itself.  The protocols
        must be designed so that end entities will use the same protocol
        regardless of whether the communication is with an RA or CA.
        Naturally, the end entity must use the correct RA or CA public
        key to protect the communication.</li>
            <li>Where an end entity requests a certificate containing a given
        public key value, the end entity must be ready to demonstrate
        possession of the corresponding private key value.  This may be
        accomplished in various ways, depending on the type of
        certification request.  See <xref target="sect-4.3" format="default"/> for details of the in-
        band methods defined for the PKIX-CMP (i.e., Certificate
        Management Protocol) messages.</li>

     At a high level, the set of operations for which management
     messages are defined can be grouped as follows.</t>

          <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>CA establishment: When establishing a new CA, certain steps are
       required (e.g., production of initial CRLs, export of CA public
       key).</li>
            <li>End entity initialization: this includes importing a root CA
       public key and requesting information about the options supported
       by a PKI management entity.</li>
            <li>
              <t>Certification: various operations result in the creation of new
       certificates:</t>
              <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>initial registration/certification: This is the process
           whereby an end entity first makes itself known to a CA or RA,
           prior to the CA issuing a certificate or certificates for
           that end entity.  The end result of this process (when it is
           successful) is that a CA issues a certificate for an end
           entity's public key, and returns that certificate to the end
           entity and/or posts that certificate in a public repository.
           This process may, and typically will, involve multiple
           "steps", possibly including an initialization of the end
           entity's equipment.  For example, the end entity's equipment
           must be securely initialized with the public key of a CA, to
           be used in validating certificate paths.  Furthermore, an end
           entity typically needs to be initialized with its own key
           pair(s).</li>
                <li>key pair update: Every key pair needs to be updated regularly
           (i.e., replaced with a new key pair), and a new certificate
           needs to be issued.</li>
                <li>certificate update: As certificates expire, they may be
           "refreshed" if nothing relevant in the environment has
           changed.</li>
                <li>CA key pair update: As with end entities, CA key pairs need
           to be updated regularly; however, different mechanisms are
           required.</li>
                <li>
                  <t>cross-certification request: One CA requests issuance of a
           cross-certificate from another CA.  For the purposes of this
           standard, the following terms are defined.  A "cross-certificate" is a certificate in which the subject CA and the
           issuer CA are distinct and SubjectPublicKeyInfo contains a
           verification key (i.e., the certificate has been issued for
           the subject CA's signing key pair).  When it is necessary to
           distinguish more finely, the following terms may be used: a
           cross-certificate is called an "inter-domain cross-certificate" if the subject and issuer CAs belong to
           different administrative domains; it is called an "intra-domain cross-certificate" otherwise.</t>
                  <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
				    <li>Note 1.  The above definition of "cross-certificate"
               aligns with the defined term "CA-certificate" in X.509.
               Note that this term is not to be confused with the X.500
               "cACertificate" attribute type, which is unrelated.</li>
                    <li>Note 2.  In many environments, the term "cross-certificate", unless further qualified, will be
               understood to be synonymous with "inter-domain cross-certificate" as defined above.</li>
                    <li>Note 3.  Issuance of cross-certificates may be, but is
               not necessarily, mutual; that is, two CAs may issue
               cross-certificates for each other.</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>cross-certificate update: Similar to a normal certificate
           update, but involving a cross-certificate.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Certificate/CRL discovery operations: some PKI management
       operations result in the publication of certificates or CRLs:</t>
              <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
			    <li>certificate publication: Having gone to the trouble of
           producing a certificate, some means for publishing it is
           needed.  The "means" defined in PKIX MAY involve the messages
           specified in Sections <xref target="sect-5.3.13" format="counter"/> to <xref target="sect-5.3.16" format="counter"/>, or MAY involve other
           methods (LDAP, for example) as described in <xref target="RFC4510" format="default"/>,
           <xref target="RFC4510" format="default"/> (the "Operational Protocols" documents of the PKIX
           series of specifications).</li>
                <li>CRL publication: As for certificate publication.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Recovery operations: some PKI management operations are used when
       an end entity has "lost" its PSE:</t>
              <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>key pair recovery: As an option, user client key materials
           (e.g., a user's private key used for decryption purposes) MAY
           be backed up by a CA, an RA, or a key backup system
           associated with a CA or RA.  If an entity needs to recover
           these backed up key materials (e.g., as a result of a
           forgotten password or a lost key chain file), a protocol
           exchange may be needed to support such recovery.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Revocation operations: some PKI management operations result in the creation
       of new CRL entries and/or new CRLs:</t>
              <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>revocation request: An authorized person advises a CA of an
           abnormal situation requiring certificate revocation.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>PSE operations: whilst the definition of PSE operations (e.g.,
       moving a PSE, changing a PIN, etc.) are beyond the scope of this
       specification, we do define a PKIMessage (CertRepMessage) that
       can form the basis of such operations.</li>
          </ol>
          <t>
   Note that on-line protocols are not the only way of implementing the
   above operations.  For all operations, there are off-line methods of
   achieving the same result, and this specification does not mandate
   use of on-line protocols.  For example, when hardware tokens are
   used, many of the operations MAY be achieved as part of the physical
   token delivery.</t>
          <t>
   Later sections define a set of standard messages supporting the above
   operations.  Transport protocols for conveying these exchanges in
   different environments (e.g., off-line: file-based, on-line: mail, HTTP [RFCDDDD], and CoAP [RFCEEEE]) are
   beyond the scope of this document and are specified separately.</t>

        <name>Initial Registration/Certification</name>
        <t>
   There are many schemes that can be used to achieve initial
   registration and certification of end entities.  No one method is
   suitable for all situations due to the range of policies that a CA
   may implement and the variation in the types of end entity which can
   occur.</t>
        <t>
   However, we can classify the initial registration/certification
   schemes that are supported by this specification.  Note that the word
   "initial", above, is crucial: we are dealing with the situation where
   the end entity in question has had no previous contact with the PKI.
   Where the end entity already possesses certified keys, then some
   simplifications/alternatives are possible.</t>
        <t>
   Having classified the schemes that are supported by this
   specification we can then specify some as mandatory and some as
   optional.  The goal is that the mandatory schemes cover a sufficient
   number of the cases that will arise in real use, whilst the optional
   schemes are available for special cases that arise less frequently.
   In this way, we achieve a balance between flexibility and ease of
   implementation.</t>

            <t>
   In terms of the PKI messages that are produced, we can regard the
   initiation of the initial registration/certification exchanges as
   occurring wherever the first PKI message relating to the end entity
   is produced.  Note that the real-world initiation of the
   registration/certification procedure may occur elsewhere (e.g., a
   personnel department may telephone an RA operator).</t>
            <t>
   The possible locations are at the end entity, an RA, or a CA.</t>

            <name>End Entity Message Origin Authentication</name>
            <t>
   The on-line messages produced by the end entity that requires a
   certificate may be authenticated or not.  The requirement here is to
   authenticate the origin of any messages from the end entity to the
   PKI (CA/RA).</t>
            <t>In this specification, such authentication is achieved by two different means:</t>
 			<ul spacing="normal">
				<li>symmetric: The PKI (CA/RA) issuing the end entity with a secret value (initial authentication key) and reference value (used to identify the secret value) via some out-of-band means.  The initial authentication key can then be used to protect relevant PKI messages.</li>
				<li>asymmetric: Using a private key and certificate issued by another PKI trusted for initial authentication, e.g., an IDevID <xref target="IEEE.802.1AR_2018" format="default">IEEE&nbsp;802.1AR</xref>.  The trust establishment in this external PKI is out of scope of this document.</li>
				</ul>
           <t>
   Thus, we can classify the initial registration/certification scheme
   according to whether or not the on-line end entity -&gt; PKI messages
   are authenticated or not.</t>
            <t>
   Note 1: We do not discuss the authentication of the PKI -&gt; end entity
   messages here, as this is always REQUIRED.  In any case, it can be
   achieved simply once the root-CA public key has been installed at the
   end entity's equipment or it can be based on the initial
   authentication key.</t>
            <t>
   Note 2: An initial registration/certification procedure can be secure
   where the messages from the end entity are authenticated via some
   out-of-band means (e.g., a subsequent visit).</t>

   In this specification, "key generation" is regarded as occurring
   wherever either the public or private component of a key pair first
   occurs in a PKIMessage.  Note that this does not preclude a
   centralized key generation service by a KGA; the actual key pair MAY have been
   generated elsewhere and transported to the end entity, RA, or CA
   using a (proprietary or standardized) key generation request/response
   protocol (outside the scope of this specification).</t>
            <t>
   Thus, there are three possibilities for the location of "key generation":  the end entity, an RA, or a CA.</t>

   Following the creation of an initial certificate for an end entity,
   additional assurance can be gained by having the end entity
   explicitly confirm successful receipt of the message containing (or
   indicating the creation of) the certificate.  Naturally, this
   confirmation message must be protected (based on the initial
   symmetric or asymmetric authentication key or other means).</t>

   This gives two further possibilities: confirmed or not.</t>

        <name>Proof-of-Possession (POP) of Private Key</name>
		<t>&lt; ToDo: To be aligned with <xref target="sect-5.2.8" format="default"/> if needed. &gt;</t>
        <t>
   In order to prevent certain attacks and to allow a CA/RA to properly
   check the validity of the binding between an end entity and a key
   pair, the PKI management operations specified here make it possible
   for an end entity to prove that it has possession of (i.e., is able
   to use) the private key corresponding to the public key for which a
   certificate is requested.  A given CA/RA is free to choose how to
   enforce POP (e.g., out-of-band procedural means versus PKIX-CMP
   in-band messages) in its certification exchanges (i.e., this may be a
   policy issue).  However, it is REQUIRED that CAs/RAs MUST enforce POP
   by some means because there are currently many non-PKIX operational
   protocols in use (various electronic mail protocols are one example)
   that do not explicitly check the binding between the end entity and
   the private key.  Until operational protocols that do verify the
   binding (for signature, encryption, and key agreement key pairs)
   exist, and are ubiquitous, this binding can only be assumed to have
   been verified by the CA/RA.  Therefore, if the binding is not
   verified by the CA/RA, certificates in the Internet Public-Key
   Infrastructure end up being somewhat less meaningful.</t>
        <t>
   POP is accomplished in different ways depending upon the type of key
   for which a certificate is requested.  If a key can be used for
   multiple purposes (e.g., an RSA key) then any appropriate method MAY
   be used (e.g., a key that may be used for signing, as well as other
   purposes, SHOULD NOT be sent to the CA/RA in order to prove
   possession).</t>
        <t>
   This specification explicitly allows for cases where an end entity
   supplies the relevant proof to an RA and the RA subsequently attests
   to the CA that the required proof has been received (and validated!).
   For example, an end entity wishing to have a signing key certified
   could send the appropriate signature to the RA, which then simply
   notifies the relevant CA that the end entity has supplied the
   required proof.  Of course, such a situation may be disallowed by
   some policies (e.g., CAs may be the only entities permitted to verify
   POP during certification).</t>
        <section anchor="sect-4.3.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Signature Keys</name>

   For encryption keys, the end entity can provide the private key to
   the CA/RA, or can be required to decrypt a value in order to prove
   possession of the private key (see <xref target="sect-5.2.8" format="default"/>).  Decrypting a
   value can be achieved either directly or indirectly.</t>
          <t>
   The direct method is for the RA/CA to issue a random challenge to
   which an immediate response by the EE is required.</t>
          <t>
   The indirect method is to issue a certificate that is encrypted for
   the end entity (and have the end entity demonstrate its ability to
   decrypt this certificate in the confirmation message).  This allows a
   CA to issue a certificate in a form that can only be used by the
   intended end entity.</t>
          <t>
   This specification encourages use of the indirect method because it
   requires no extra messages to be sent (i.e., the proof can be
   demonstrated using the {request, response, confirmation} triple of
   messages).</t>

   For key agreement keys, the end entity and the PKI management entity
   (i.e., CA or RA) must establish a shared secret key in order to prove

   Note that this need not impose any restrictions on the keys that can
   be certified by a given CA.  In particular, for Diffie-Hellman keys

        <name>Root CA Key Update</name>
        <t>
   This discussion only applies to CAs that are directly trusted by some
   end entities.  Self-signed CAs SHALL be considered as directly
   trusted CAs.  Recognizing whether a non-self-signed CA is supposed to
   be directly trusted for some end entities is a matter of CA policy
   and is thus beyond the scope of this document.</t>
        <t>
   The basis of the procedure described here is that the CA protects its
   new public key using its previous private key and vice versa.  Thus,
   when a CA updates its key pair it must generate two extra
   cACertificate attribute values if certificates are made available
   using an X.500 directory (for a total of four: OldWithOld,
   OldWithNew, NewWithOld, and NewWithNew).</t>
        <t>
   When a CA changes its key pair, those entities who have acquired the
   old CA public key via "out-of-band" means are most affected.  It is
   these end entities who will need access to the new CA public key
   protected with the old CA private key.  However, they will only
   require this for a limited period (until they have acquired the new
   CA public key via the "out-of-band" mechanism).  This will typically
   be easily achieved when these end entities' certificates expire.</t>
        <t>
   The data structure used to protect the new and old CA public keys is
   a standard certificate (which may also contain extensions).  There
   are no new data structures required.</t>
        <t>
   Note 1:  This scheme does not make use of any of the X.509 v3
   extensions as it must be able to work even for version 1
   certificates.  The presence of the KeyIdentifier extension would make
   for efficiency improvements.</t>
        <t>
   Note 2:.  While the scheme could be generalized to cover cases where
   the CA updates its key pair more than once during the validity period
   of one of its end entities' certificates, this generalization seems
   of dubious value.  Not having this generalization simply means that
   the validity periods of certificates issued with the old CA key pair
   cannot exceed the end of the OldWithNew validity period.</t>
        <t>
   Note 3:  This scheme ensures that end entities will acquire the new
   CA public key, at the latest by the expiry of the last certificate
   they owned that was signed with the old CA private key (via the
   "out-of-band" means).  Certificate and/or key update operations
   occurring at other times do not necessarily require this (depending
   on the end entity's equipment).</t>
		<t>Note 4:  In practice, a new root CA may have a slightly different subject DN, e.g., indicating a generation identifier like the year of issuance or a version number, for instance in an OU element.  How to bridge trust to the new root CA certificate in a CA DN change or a cross-certificate scenario is out of scope for this document.</t>

       using the "out-of-band" mechanism (if required).</li>
          </ol>
          <t>
   The old CA private key is then no longer required.  However, the old
   CA public key will remain in use for some time.  The old CA public
   key is no longer required (other than for non-repudiation) when all
   end entities of this CA have securely acquired the new CA public key.</t>

          <t>The "new with new" certificate must have a validity period with a notBefore time that is before the notAfter time of the "old with old" certificate and a notAfter time that is after the notBefore time of the next update of this certificate.</t>

   where protection of the message uses Diffie-Hellman (DH) keys).
   These fields MUST be used if required to uniquely identify a key
   (e.g., if more than one key is associated with a given sender name).
   The senderKID SHOULD be used in any case.</t>
		  <t>Note: The recommendation of using senderKID was changed since [RFC4210], where it was recommended to be omitted if not needed to identify the protection key.</t>

          <t>
   The transactionID field within the message header is to be used to
   allow the recipient of a message to correlate this with an ongoing
   transaction.  This is needed for all transactions that consist of
   more than just a single request/response pair.  For transactions that
   consist of a single request/response pair, the rules are as follows.
   A client MAY populate the transactionID field of the request.  If a
   server receives such a request that has the transactionID field set,
   then it MUST set the transactionID field of the response to the same
   value.  If a server receives such request with a missing
   transactionID field, then it MAY set transactionID field of the
   response.</t>
          <t>
   For transactions that consist of more than just a single
   request/response pair, the rules are as follows.  Clients SHOULD
   generate a transactionID for the first request.  If a server receives
   such a request that has the transactionID field set, then it MUST set
   the transactionID field of the response to the same value.  If a
   server receives such request with a missing transactionID field, then
   it MUST populate the transactionID field of the response with a
   server-generated ID.  Subsequent requests and responses MUST all set
   the transactionID field to the thus established value.  In all cases
   where a transactionID is being used, a given client MUST NOT have
   more than one transaction with the same transactionID in progress at
   any time (to a given server).  Servers are free to require uniqueness
   of the transactionID or not, as long as they are able to correctly
   associate messages with the corresponding transaction.  Typically,
   this means that a server will require the {client, transactionID}
   tuple to be unique, or even the transactionID alone to be unique, if
   it cannot distinguish clients based on transport-level information.
   A server receiving the first message of a transaction (which requires
   more than a single request/response pair) that contains a
   transactionID that does not allow it to meet the above constraints
   (typically because the transactionID is already in use) MUST send
   back an ErrorMsgContent with a PKIFailureInfo of transactionIdInUse.
   It is RECOMMENDED that the clients fill the transactionID field with
   128 bits of (pseudo-) random data for the start of a transaction to
   reduce the probability of having the transactionID in use at the
   server.</t>
          <t>
   The senderNonce and recipNonce fields protect the PKIMessage against
   replay attacks.  The senderNonce will typically be 128 bits of
   (pseudo-) random data generated by the sender, whereas the recipNonce
   is copied from the senderNonce of the previous message in the
   transaction.</t>
          <t>
   The messageTime field contains the time at which the sender created
   the message.  This may be useful to allow end entities to
   correct/check their local time for consistency with the time on a
   central system.</t>
          <t>
   The freeText field may be used to send a human-readable message to
   the recipient (in any number of languages).  The first language used
   in this sequence indicates the desired language for replies.</t>
          <t>
   The generalInfo field may be used to send machine-processable
   additional data to the recipient.  The following generalInfo
   extensions are defined and MAY be supported.</t>

          <t keepWithNext="true">
   The input to the calculation of PKIProtection is the DER encoding of
   the following data structure:</t>

  ProtectedPart ::= SEQUENCE {
     header    PKIHeader,
     body      PKIBody

]]></sourcecode>
          <t>
   There MAY be cases in which the PKIProtection BIT STRING is
   deliberately not used to protect a message (i.e., this OPTIONAL field
   is omitted) because other protection, external to PKIX, will be
   applied instead.  Such a choice is explicitly allowed in this
   specification.  Examples of such external protection include CMS
   <xref target="RFC5652" format="default"/> and Security Multiparts <xref target="RFC1847" format="default"/> encapsulation of the
   PKIMessage (or simply the PKIBody (omitting the CHOICE tag), if the
   relevant PKIHeader information is securely carried in the external
   mechanism).  It is noted, however, that many such external mechanisms
   require that the end entity already possesses a public-key
   certificate, and/or a unique Distinguished Name, and/or other such
   infrastructure-related information.  Thus, they may not be
   appropriate for initial registration, key-recovery, or any other
   process with "boot-strapping" characteristics.  For those cases it
   may be necessary that the PKIProtection parameter be used.  In the
   future, if/when external mechanisms are modified to accommodate
   boot-strapping scenarios, the use of PKIProtection may become rare or
   non-existent.</t>
          <t>
   Depending on the circumstances, the PKIProtection bits may contain a
   Message Authentication Code (MAC) or signature.  Only the following
   cases can occur:</t>

   Where the sender and receiver possess finite-field or elliptic-curve-based Diffie-Hellman certificates
   with compatible DH parameters, in order to protect the message the
   end entity must generate a symmetric key based on its private DH key
   value and the DH public key of the recipient of the PKI message.
   PKIProtection will contain a MAC value keyed with this derived
   symmetric key and the protectionAlg will be the following:</t>
		<sourcecode type="asn.1" ><![CDATA[
  id-DHBasedMac OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {1 2 840 113533 7 66 30}

     -- the MAC AlgId
  }
]]></sourcecode>
            <t>
   In the above protectionAlg, OWF is applied to the result of the
   Diffie-Hellman computation.  The OWF output (called "BASEKEY" for
   ease of reference, with a size of "H") is what is used to form the
   symmetric key.  If the MAC algorithm requires a K-bit key and K &lt;= H, then the most significant K bits of BASEKEY are used.  If K &gt; H, then
   all of BASEKEY is used for the most significant H bits of the key,
   OWF("1" || BASEKEY) is used for the next most significant H bits of
   the key, OWF("2" || BASEKEY) is used for the next most significant H
   bits of the key, and so on, until all K bits have been derived.
   [Here "N" is the ASCII byte encoding the number N and "||" represents concatenation.]</t>

   In this case, the sender possesses a signature key pair and simply

   value and the protectionAlg will be an AlgorithmIdentifier for a

				<t>When receiving a protected PKI message, a PKI management entity such as an RA MAY forward that message adding its own protection (which is a MAC or a signature, depending on the information and certificates shared between the RA and the CA).  Additionally, multiple PKI messages MAY be aggregated.  There are several use cases for such messages.</t>
				<ul spacing="normal">

This can for instance be used when bridging an off-line connection between two PKI management entities.</li>

   Before specifying the specific types that may be placed in a PKIBody,
   we define some data structures that are used in more than one case.</t>
        <section anchor="sect-5.2.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Requested Certificate Contents</name>
          <t>
   Various PKI management messages require that the originator of the
   message indicate some of the fields that are required to be present
   in a certificate.  The CertTemplate structure allows an end entity or
   RA to specify as much as it wishes about the certificate it requires.
   CertTemplate is identical to a Certificate, but with all fields
   optional.</t>
          <t>
   Note: Even if the originator completely specifies the contents of
   a certificate it requires, a CA is free to modify fields within the
   certificate actually issued.  If the modified certificate is
   unacceptable to the requester, the requester MUST send back a
   certConf message that either does not include this certificate (via a
   CertHash), or does include this certificate (via a CertHash) along
   with a status of "rejected".  See <xref target="sect-5.3.18" format="default"/> for the definition
   and use of CertHash and the certConf message.</t>
		  <t>Note: Before requesting a new certificate, an end entity can request a certTemplate structure as a kind of certificate request blueprint, in order to learn which data the CA expects to be present in the certificate request, see <xref target="sect-5.3.19.16" format="default"/>.</t>
          <t>See <xref target="RFC4211" format="default">CRMF</xref> for CertTemplate syntax.</t>
		  <t>If certTemplate is an empty SEQUENCE (i.e., all fields omitted), then the controls field in the CertRequest structure MAY contain the id-regCtrl-altCertTemplate control, specifying a template for a certificate other than an X.509v3 public-key certificate.

   If the cert. request is for a key agreement key (KAK) pair, then the
   POP can use any of the 3 ways described above for enc. key pairs,
   with the following changes: (1) the parenthetical text of <xref target="sect-5.2.8.2" format="default"/>
   is replaced with "(i.e., the certificate encrypted under the symmetric key derived from the CA's private KAK and the public key for which the certification request is being made)"; (2) the first

   replaced with "(using PreferredSymmAlg (see <xref target="sect-5.3.19.4" format="default"/> and <xref target="sect-e.5" format="default"/>) and a symmetric key derived from the CA's private KAK and the public key for which the certification request is being made)".  Alternatively, the POP can use the POPOSigningKey structure
   given in <xref target="RFC4211" format="default"/> (where the alg field is DHBasedMAC and the signature
   field is the MAC) as a fourth alternative for demonstrating POP if
   the CA already has a D-H certificate that is known to the EE.</t>

   The challenge-response messages for proof-of-possession of a private

   with the preceding cert. request message (and subsequent cert.
   response and confirmation messages) by the transactionID used in the
   PKIHeader and by the protection (MACing or signing) applied to the
   PKIMessage.</t>

            <name>Summary of PoP Options</name>
            <t>
   The text in this section provides several options with respect to POP
   techniques.  Using "SK" for "signing key", "EK" for "encryption key",
   and "KAK" for "key agreement key", the techniques may be summarized
   as follows:</t>
            <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt=""><![CDATA[
   RAVerified;
   SKPOP;
   EKPOPThisMessage;
   KAKPOPThisMessage;
   KAKPOPThisMessageDHMAC;
   EKPOPEncryptedCert;
   KAKPOPEncryptedCert;
   EKPOPChallengeResp; and
   KAKPOPChallengeResp.
]]></artwork>
            <t>
   Given this array of options, it is natural to ask how an end entity
   can know what is supported by the CA/RA (i.e., which options it may
   use when requesting certificates).  The following guidelines should
   clarify this situation for EE implementers.</t>
            <t>
   RAVerified.  This is not an EE decision; the RA uses this if and only
   if it has verified POP before forwarding the request on to the CA, so
   it is not possible for the EE to choose this technique.</t>
            <t>
   SKPOP.  If the EE has a signing key pair, this is the only POP method
   specified for use in the request for a corresponding certificate.</t>
            <t>
   EKPOPThisMessage and KAKPOPThisMessage.  Whether or not to give up
   its private key to the CA/RA is an EE decision.  If the EE decides to
   reveal its key, then these are the only POP methods available in this
   specification to achieve this (and the key pair type will determine
   which of these two methods to use).</t>
            <t>
   KAKPOPThisMessageDHMAC.  The EE can only use this method if (1) the
   CA has a DH certificate available for this purpose, and (2) the EE
   already has a copy of this certificate.  If both these conditions
   hold, then this technique is clearly supported and may be used by the
   EE, if desired.</t>
            <t>
   EKPOPEncryptedCert, KAKPOPEncryptedCert, EKPOPChallengeResp,
   KAKPOPChallengeResp.  The EE picks one of these (in the
   subsequentMessage field) in the request message, depending upon
   preference and key pair type.  The EE is not doing POP at this point;
   it is simply indicating which method it wants to use.  Therefore, if
   the CA/RA replies with a "badPOP" error, the EE can re-request using
   the other POP method chosen in subsequentMessage.  Note, however,
   that this specification encourages the use of the EncryptedCert
   choice and, furthermore, says that the challenge-response would
   typically be used when an RA is involved and doing POP verification.
   Thus, the EE should be able to make an intelligent decision regarding
   which of these POP methods to choose in the request message.</t>

          <name>One-Way Request-Response Scheme:</name>
          <t>
   The cross-certification scheme is essentially a one way operation;
   that is, when successful, this operation results in the creation of
   one new cross-certificate.  If the requirement is that cross-
   certificates be created in "both directions", then each CA, in turn,
   must initiate a cross-certification operation (or use another
   scheme).</t>
          <t>
   This scheme is suitable where the two CAs in question can already
   verify each other's signatures (they have some common points of
   trust) or where there is an out-of-band verification of the origin of
   the certification request.</t>
          <t>
   Detailed Description:</t>
          <t>
   Cross certification is initiated at one CA known as the responder.
   The CA administrator for the responder identifies the CA it wants to
   cross certify and the responder CA equipment generates an
   authorization code.  The responder CA administrator passes this
   authorization code by out-of-band means to the requester CA
   administrator.  The requester CA administrator enters the
   authorization code at the requester CA in order to initiate the on-
   line exchange.</t>
          <t>
   The authorization code is used for authentication and integrity
   purposes.  This is done by generating a symmetric key based on the
   authorization code and using the symmetric key for generating Message
   Authentication Codes (MACs) on all messages exchanged.
   (Authentication may alternatively be done using signatures instead of
   MACs, if the CAs are able to retrieve and validate the required
   public keys by some means, such as an out-of-band hash comparison.)</t>
          <t>
   The requester CA initiates the exchange by generating a cross-
   certification request (ccr) with a fresh random number (requester
   random number).  The requester CA then sends the ccr message to the
   responder CA.  The fields in this message are protected from
   modification with a MAC based on the authorization code.</t>
          <t>
   Upon receipt of the ccr message, the responder CA validates the
   message and the MAC, saves the requester random number, and generates
   its own random number (responder random number).  It then generates
   (and archives, if desired) a new requester certificate that contains
   the requester CA public key and is signed with the responder CA
   signature private key.  The responder CA responds with the cross
   certification response (ccp) message.  The fields in this message are
   protected from modification with a MAC based on the authorization
   code.</t>
          <t>
   Upon receipt of the ccp message, the requester CA validates the
   message (including the received random numbers) and the MAC.  The
   requester CA responds with the certConf message.  The fields in this
   message are protected from modification with a MAC based on the
   authorization code.  The requester CA MAY write the requester
   certificate to the Repository as an aid to later certificate path
   construction.</t>
          <t>
   Upon receipt of the certConf message, the responder CA validates the
   message and the MAC, and sends back an acknowledgement using the
   PKIConfirm message.  It MAY also publish the requester certificate as
   an aid to later path construction.</t>
          <t>
   Notes:</t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>The ccr message must contain a "complete" certification request;
       that is, all fields except the serial number (including, e.g., a
       BasicConstraints extension) must be specified by the requester
       CA.</li>
            <li>The ccp message SHOULD contain the verification certificate of
       the responder CA; if present, the requester CA must then verify
       this certificate (for example, via the "out-of-band" mechanism).</li>
          </ol>
          <t>
   (A simpler, non-interactive model of cross-certification may also be
   envisioned, in which the issuing CA acquires the subject CA's public
   key from some repository, verifies it via some out-of-band mechanism,
   and creates and publishes the cross-certificate without the subject
   CA's explicit involvement.  This model may be perfectly legitimate
   for many environments, but since it does not require any protocol
   message exchanges, its detailed description is outside the scope of
   this specification.)</t>

          <name>Acquisition of PKI Information</name>

          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>the current root-CA public key</li>

          <t>
   Additional information could be required (e.g., supported extensions
   or CA policy information) in order to produce a certification request
   that will be successful.  However, for simplicity we do not mandate
   that the end entity acquires this information via the PKI messages.
   The end result is simply that some certification requests may fail
   (e.g., if the end entity wants to generate its own encryption key,
   but the CA doesn't allow that).</t>

   An end entity must securely possess the public key of its root CA.
   One method to achieve this is to provide the end entity with the CA's
   self-certificate fingerprint via some secure "out-of-band" means.

   An initialized end entity MAY request an additional certificate at
   any time (for any purpose).  This request will be made using the
   certification request (cr) message.  If the end entity already
   possesses a signing key pair (with a corresponding verification
   certificate), then this cr message will typically be protected by the

   When a key pair is due to expire, the relevant end entity MAY request
   a key update; that is, it MAY request that the CA issue a new
   certificate for a new key pair (or, in certain circumstances, a new
   certificate for the same key pair).  The request is made using a key
   update request (kur) message (referred to, in some environments, as a
   "Certificate Update" operation).  If the end entity already possesses
   a signing key pair (with a corresponding verification certificate),
   then this message will typically be protected by the entity's digital
   signature.  The CA returns the new certificate (if the request is
   successful) in a key update response (kup) message, which is
   syntactically identical to a CertRepMessage.</t>

	  <t>If a client knows the protocol version(s) supported by the server (e.g., from a previous PKIMessage exchange or via some out-of-band means), then it MUST send a PKIMessage with the highest version supported by both it and the server.  If a client does not know what version(s) the server supports, then it MUST send a PKIMessage using the highest version it supports, with the following exception. Version cmp2021 SHOULD only be used if cmp2021 syntax is needed for the request being sent or for the expected response.</t>
	  <t>Note: Using cmp2000 as the default pvno is done to avoid extra message exchanges for version negotiation and to foster compatibility with cmp2000 implementations. Version cmp2021 syntax is only needed if a message exchange uses hashAlg (in CertStatus) or EnvelopedData.</t>
      <t>
   If a server receives a message with a version that it supports, then
   the version of the response message MUST be the same as the received
   version.  If a server receives a message with a version higher or
   lower than it supports, then it MUST send back an ErrorMsg with the
   unsupportedVersion bit set (in the failureInfo field of the
   pKIStatusInfo).  If the received version is higher than the highest
   supported version, then the version in the error message MUST be the
   highest version the server supports; if the received version is lower
   than the lowest supported version then the version in the error
   message MUST be the lowest version the server supports.</t>

        <name>Proof-Of-Possession with a Decryption Key</name>
        <t>
   Some cryptographic considerations are worth explicitly spelling out.
   In the protocols specified above, when an end entity is required to
   prove possession of a decryption key, it is effectively challenged to
   decrypt something (its own certificate).  This scheme (and many
   others!) could be vulnerable to an attack if the possessor of the
   decryption key in question could be fooled into decrypting an
   arbitrary challenge and returning the cleartext to an attacker.
   Although in this specification a number of other failures in security
   are required in order for this attack to succeed, it is conceivable
   that some future services (e.g., notary, trusted time) could
   potentially be vulnerable to such attacks.  For this reason, we re-
   iterate the general rule that implementations should be very careful
   about decrypting arbitrary "ciphertext" and revealing recovered
   "plaintext" since such a practice can lead to serious security
   vulnerabilities.</t>

        <name>Attack Against Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange</name>
        <t>
   A small subgroup attack during a Diffie-Hellman key exchange may be
   carried out as follows.  A malicious end entity may deliberately
   choose D-H parameters that enable him/her to derive (a significant
   number of bits of) the D-H private key of the CA during a key
   archival or key recovery operation.  Armed with this knowledge, the
   EE would then be able to retrieve the decryption private key of
   another unsuspecting end entity, EE2, during EE2's legitimate key
   archival or key recovery operation with that CA.  In order to avoid
   the possibility of such an attack, two courses of action are
   available.  (1) The CA may generate a fresh D-H key pair to be used
   as a protocol encryption key pair for each EE with which it
   interacts.  (2) The CA may enter into a key validation protocol (not
   specified in this document) with each requesting end entity to ensure
   that the EE's protocol encryption key pair will not facilitate this
   attack.  Option (1) is clearly simpler (requiring no extra protocol
   exchanges from either party) and is therefore RECOMMENDED.</t>

      <section anchor="sect-8.5" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Entropy of Random Numbers, Key Pairs, and Shared Secret Information</name>
		<t>Implementations must generate nonces and private keys from random input. The use of inadequate pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) to generate cryptographic keys can result in little or no security. An attacker may find it much easier to reproduce the PRNG environment that produced the keys and to search the resulting small set of possibilities than brute-force searching the whole key space. As an example of predictable random numbers see <xref target="CVE-2008-0166" format="default"/>; consequences of low-entropy random numbers are discussed in <xref target="MiningPsQs" format="default">Mining Your Ps and Qs</xref>. The generation of quality random numbers is difficult. <xref target="ISO.20543-2019" format="default">ISO/IEC 20543:2019</xref>, <xref target="NIST_SP_800_90Ar1" format="default">NIST SP 800-90A Rev.1</xref>, <xref target="AIS31" format="default">BSI AIS 31 V2.0</xref>, and others offer valuable guidance in this area.</t>
		<t>If shared secret information is generated by a cryptographically secure random-number generator (CSRNG) it is safe to assume that the entropy of the shared secret information equals its bit length. If no CSRNG is used, the entropy of a shared secret information depends on the details of the generation process and cannot be measured securely after it has been generated. If user-generated passwords are used as shared secret information, their entropy cannot be measured and are typically insufficient for protected delivery of centrally generated keys or trust anchors.</t>
		<t>If the entropy of a shared secret information protecting the delivery of a centrally generated key pair is known, it should not be less than the security strength of that key pair; if the shared secret information is re-used for different key pairs, the security of the shared secret information should exceed the security strength of each individual key pair.</t>
		<t>For the case of a PKI management operation that delivers a new trust anchor (e.g., a root CA certificate) using caPubs or genm (a) that is not concluded in a timely manner or (b) where the shared secret information is re-used for several key management operations, the entropy of the shared secret information, if known, should not be less than the security strength of the trust anchor being managed by the operation. The shared secret information should have an entropy that at least matches the security strength of the key material being managed by the operation. Certain use cases may require shared secret information that may be of a low security strength, e.g., a human generated password. It is RECOMMENDED that such secret information be limited to a single PKI management operation. </t>

        <name>Trust Anchor Provisioning Using CMP Messages</name>
		<t>A provider of trust anchors, which may be an RA involved in configuration management of its clients, MUST NOT include to-be-trusted CA certificates in a CMP message unless the specific deployment scenario can ensure that it is adequate that the receiving EE trusts these certificates, e.g., by loading them into its trust store.</t>
		<t>Whenever an EE receives in a CMP message, e.g., in the caPubs field of a certificate response or in a general response (genp), a CA certificate for use as a trust anchor, it MUST properly authenticate the message sender with existing trust anchors without requiring new trust anchors included in the message.</t>
		<t>Additionally, the EE MUST verify that the sender is an authorized source of trust anchors.  This authorization is governed by local policy and typically indicated using shared secret information or with a signature-based message protection using a certificate issued by a PKI that is explicitly authorized for this purpose.</t>

      <name>Reasons for the Presence of RAs</name>
      <t>
   The reasons that justify the presence of an RA can be split into
   those that are due to technical factors and those which are
   organizational in nature.  Technical reasons include the following.</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>If hardware tokens are in use, then not all end entities will have
      the equipment needed to initialize these; the RA equipment can
      include the necessary functionality (this may also be a matter of
      policy).</li>
        <li>Some end entities may not have the capability to publish
      certificates; again, the RA may be suitably placed for this.</li>
        <li>The RA will be able to issue signed revocation requests on behalf
      of end entities associated with it, whereas the end entity may not
      be able to do this (if the key pair is completely lost).</li>
      </ul>
      <t>
   Some of the organizational reasons that argue for the presence of an
   RA are the following.</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>It may be more cost effective to concentrate functionality in the
      RA equipment than to supply functionality to all end entities
      (especially if special token initialization equipment is to be
      used).</li>
        <li>Establishing RAs within an organization can reduce the number of
      CAs required, which is sometimes desirable.</li>
        <li>RAs may be better placed to identify people with their
      "electronic" names, especially if the CA is physically remote from
      the end entity.</li>
        <li>For many applications, there will already be in place some
      administrative structure so that candidates for the role of RA are
      easy to find (which may not be true of the CA).</li>
      </ul>
	  <t>Further reasons relevant for automated machine-to-machine certificate lifecycle management are available in the Lightweight CMP Profile [RFCBBBB].</t>

   A revocation request must incorporate suitable security mechanisms,
   including proper authentication, in order to reduce the probability
   of successful denial-of-service attacks.  A digital signature on the
   request -- REQUIRED to support within this specification if
   revocation requests are supported -- can provide the authentication
   required, but there are circumstances under which an alternative
   mechanism may be desirable (e.g., when the private key is no longer
   accessible and the entity wishes to request a revocation prior to
   re-certification of another key pair).  In order to accommodate such
   circumstances, a password-based MAC, see CMP Algorithms [RFCCCCC] Section 6.1, on the request is also REQUIRED to
   support within this specification (subject to local security policy
   for a given environment) if revocation requests are supported and if
   shared secret information can be established between the requester
   and the responder prior to the need for revocation.</t>
      <t>
   A mechanism that has seen use in some environments is "revocation passphrase", in which a value of sufficient entropy (i.e., a
   relatively long passphrase rather than a short password) is shared
   between (only) the entity and the CA/RA at some point prior to
   revocation; this value is later used to authenticate the revocation
   request.</t>
      <t>
   In this specification, the following technique to establish shared
   secret information (i.e., a revocation passphrase) is OPTIONAL to
   support.  Its precise use in CMP messages is as follows.</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>The OID and value specified in <xref target="sect-5.3.19.9" format="default"/> MAY be sent in a GenMsg message at any time, or MAY be sent in the generalInfo field of the PKIHeader of any PKIMessage at any time.  (In particular, the EncryptedKey structure as described in <xref target="sect-5.2.2" format="default"/> may be sent in the header of the certConf message that confirms acceptance of certificates requested in an initialization request or certificate request message.)  This conveys a revocation passphrase chosen by the entity to the relevant CA/RA. When EnvelopedData is used, this is in the decrypted bytes of encryptedContent field. When EncryptedValue is used, this is in the decrypted bytes of the encValue field. Furthermore, the transfer is accomplished with appropriate confidentiality characteristics.</li>
        <li>If a CA/RA receives the revocation passphrase (OID and value
      specified in <xref target="sect-5.3.19.9" format="default"/>) in a GenMsg, it MUST construct and
      send a GenRep message that includes the OID (with absent value)
      specified in <xref target="sect-5.3.19.9" format="default"/>. If the CA/RA receives the
      revocation passphrase in the generalInfo field of a PKIHeader of
      any PKIMessage, it MUST include the OID (with absent value) in the
      generalInfo field of the PKIHeader of the corresponding response
      PKIMessage.  If the CA/RA is unable to return the appropriate
      response message for any reason, it MUST send an error message
      with a status of "rejection" and, optionally, a failInfo reason
      set.</li>
        <li>Either the localKeyId attribute of EnvelopedData as specified in <xref target="RFC2985" format="default">RFC&nbsp;2985</xref> or the valueHint field of EncryptedValue MAY contain a key identifier (chosen by the entity, along with the passphrase itself) to assist in later retrieval of the correct passphrase (e.g., when the revocation request is constructed by the entity and received by the CA/RA).</li>
        <li>The revocation request message is protected by a password-based MAC, see CMP Algorithms [RFCCCCC] Section 6.1,
      with the revocation passphrase as the key.  If appropriate, the
      senderKID field in the PKIHeader MAY contain the value previously
      transmitted in localKeyId or valueHint.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>
   Using the technique specified above, the revocation passphrase may be
   initially established and updated at any time without requiring extra
   messages or out-of-band exchanges.  For example, the revocation
   request message itself (protected and authenticated through a MAC
   that uses the revocation passphrase as a key) may contain, in the
   PKIHeader, a new revocation passphrase to be used for authenticating
   future revocation requests for any of the entity's other
   certificates.  In some environments this may be preferable to
   mechanisms that reveal the passphrase in the revocation request
   message, since this can allow a denial-of-service attack in which the
   revealed passphrase is used by an unauthorized third party to
   authenticate revocation requests on the entity's other certificates.
   However, because the passphrase is not revealed in the request
   message, there is no requirement that the passphrase must always be
   updated when a revocation request is made (that is, the same
   passphrase MAY be used by an entity to authenticate revocation
   requests for different certificates at different times).</t>
      <t>
   Furthermore, the above technique can provide strong cryptographic
   protection over the entire revocation request message even when a
   digital signature is not used.  Techniques that do authentication of
   the revocation request by simply revealing the revocation passphrase
   typically do not provide cryptographic protection over the fields of
   the request message (so that a request for revocation of one
   certificate may be modified by an unauthorized third party to a
   request for revocation of another certificate for that entity).</t>

        <name>General Rules for Interpretation of These Profiles.</name>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>Where OPTIONAL or DEFAULT fields are not mentioned in individual
       profiles, they SHOULD be absent from the relevant message (i.e.,
       a receiver can validly reject a message containing such fields as
       being syntactically incorrect).  Mandatory fields are not
       mentioned if they have an obvious value (e.g., if not explicitly stated, pvno is cmp2000(2)).</li>
          <li>Where structures occur in more than one message, they are
       separately profiled as appropriate.</li>
          <li>The algorithmIdentifiers from PKIMessage structures are profiled
       separately.</li>
          <li>A "special" X.500 DN is called the "NULL-DN"; this means a DN
       containing a zero-length SEQUENCE OF RelativeDistinguishedNames
       (its DER encoding is then '3000'H).</li>
          <li>Where a GeneralName is required for a field, but no suitable
       value is available (e.g., an end entity produces a request before
       knowing its name), then the GeneralName is to be an X.500 NULL-DN
       (i.e., the Name field of the CHOICE is to contain a NULL-DN).
       This special value can be called a "NULL-GeneralName".</li>
          <li>Where a profile omits to specify the value for a GeneralName,
       then the NULL-GeneralName value is to be present in the relevant
       PKIMessage field.  This occurs with the sender field of the
       PKIHeader for some messages.</li>
          <li>Where any ambiguity arises due to naming of fields, the profile
       names these using a "dot" notation (e.g., "certTemplate.subject"
       means the subject field within a field called certTemplate).</li>
          <li>Where a "SEQUENCE OF types" is part of a message, a zero-based
       array notation is used to describe fields within the SEQUENCE OF
       (e.g., crm[0].certReq.certTemplate.subject refers to a subfield
       of the first CertReqMsg contained in a request message).</li>
          <li>All PKI message exchanges in <xref target="sect-d.4" format="default"/> to <xref target="sect-d.6" format="counter"/> require a
       certConf message to be sent by the initiating entity and a
       PKIConfirm to be sent by the responding entity.  The PKIConfirm
       is not included in some of the profiles given since its body is
       NULL and its header contents are clear from the context.  Any
       authenticated means can be used for the protectionAlg (e.g.,
       password-based MAC, if shared secret information is known, or
       signature).</li>

        <name>In-Band Initialization Using External Identity Certificate</name>
        <t>
   An (uninitialized) end entity wishes to initialize into the PKI with
   a CA, CA-1.  It uses, for authentication purposes, a pre-existing
   identity certificate issued by another (external) CA, CA-X.  A trust
   relationship must already have been established between CA-1 and CA-X
   so that CA-1 can validate the EE identity certificate signed by CA-X.
   Furthermore, some mechanism must already have been established within
   the Personal Security Environment (PSE) of the EE that would allow it
   to authenticate and verify PKIMessages signed by CA-1 (as one
   example, the PSE may contain a certificate issued for the public key
   of CA-1, signed by another CA that the EE trusts on the basis of
   out-of-band authentication techniques).</t>
        <t>
   The EE sends an initialization request to start the transaction.
   When CA-1 responds with a message containing the new certificate, the
   end entity replies with a certificate confirmation.  CA-1 replies
   with a PKIConfirm to close the transaction.  All messages are signed
   (the EE messages are signed using the private key that corresponds to
   the public key in its external identity certificate; the CA-1
   messages are signed using the private key that corresponds to the
